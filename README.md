## General info
In this project, we have done the EDA - Explorarity Data Analytics and applied different dimensionality reduction techniques to study the patterns provided by the data. We have also done the classification and predicted the reservation status of customer at the hotel.


## Prerequisites
To use it, you require the following:

```
1. Python3
2. Pip
```

## Installing
Once you got the requisites on your machine, execute the following command:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the required libraries for you.
	
## Dependencies
Project is created with:
* Keras: ```pip install keras```
* Numpy: ```pip install numpy```
* Matplotlib: ```pip install matplotlib```
* Seaborn: ```pip install seaborn```
* Scikit Learn: ```pip install sklearn```


	
## Setup
To run this project, you can directly open the ```classification-and-prediction.ipynb``` in jupyter notebook or google colab.
else run the ```classification-and-prediction.py```  or open the ```Dimensionality reduction and EDA.ipynb``` in jupyter notebook or google colab.
else run the ```Dimensionality reduction and EDA.py```.

Open a new terminal and execute the following:

```$ python3 classification-and-prediction.py```
```$ python3 Dimensionality reduction and EDA.py```
